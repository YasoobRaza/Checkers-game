Welcome to my Checkers game, where you can experience the classic board game with a functional programming twist! Developed using Python and Tkinter,
this game showcases the power of functional programming concepts.

## Game Rules

In Checkers, two players compete against each other, each with 12 pieces that are either black or white. The pieces are placed on the dark squares of the board, and the goal of the game is to capture all of your opponent's pieces or to block them so they can no longer make a move.

## How to Play

To get started, simply download or clone this repository, and run the ```checkergame.exe``` file. You will be presented with a beautiful graphical interface that will guide you through the game.
